Below is today practical  steps if anyone want to refer :
step 1)  we have created hellowolrd.java file in IDE
 
 compile it with "javac hellowolrd.java" then it will creeate helloworld.class file which has byte code 
 
 and then run the it with "java hellowolrd"
 

step 2) add this helloword.java file in git

commit -m "added the hello word file for Jenkins demo"
 git remote add origin https://github.com/prajktakale/myfirstpractialfromlocaltorepo
 git push -u origin main
 
step 3) on jenkins click on new item--> select freestyle project --> click on save and create 
        In configuration add the git repository
         add the git repository URL : https://github.com/prajktakale/myfirstpractialfromlocaltorepo
             (https://github.com/DevSecOpsG/helloworldsimplejavaprogram -- this is given by sir)
			 
step 4) then click on save and build it will success

step 5) In configuration only click on build steps and then select execute shell
        javac helloworld.java
		java helloworld
	Note : Make sure your class name and script name is same or test it before by running on Visual studio code

step 6) then click on save and build it, it build successfully

step 7) In configuration now change the Triggers select Poll SCM and then enter * * * * * (it will run all the time refer crontab) and save

step 8) Now change the helloword.java file and push it again (you will require to repeat  step 2) or just make changes in the code by going to repo and make a commit 
 
step 9) on Jenkins now you can see automatic build get triggered
